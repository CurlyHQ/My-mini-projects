Sure, hereâ€™s a high-level structure for a "Guess the Number" game:

1. Import Necessary Modules: 
    You may need a module for generating random numbers.
2. Initialize the Game: 
    Set up the game by selecting a random number.
3. Prompt the User: 
    Ask the user to guess the number.
4. Check the Guess: 
    Compare the user's guess with the selected number and provide feedback.
5. Loop Until Correct or Out of Tries: 
    Repeat the guessing and checking process until the user guesses correctly or runs out of tries.  
6. End the Game: 
    Display the result (win or lose) and the correct number if the user runs out of tries.

Focus on:
- How to initialize and set up the random number.
- Looping through the user's guesses and providing feedback.
- Handling the end condition for winning or running out of tries.
